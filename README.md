# LEVEL00
- First, I typed the command "cd.." and then I changed direction by entering the level folder using the command "ls level".
I chose level00. I opened the README.md file and here is the solution using "cat README.md".

- cd..
- cd level
- ls
- cd 00_welcome
- ls
- cat README.md


# LEVEL01
- First I changed direction using "cd".
Then like level 00, I chose a level, the level "01_choice tree" using the "cd level choice tree" command.
There were three folders and I chose "cd blue", after "ls", I entered the folder and I chose "cd grey", then in the grey folder there was another folder and in this file you find the solution.

- cd
- cd ..
- cd level
- ls
- cd 01_choice_tree
- cd blue
- ls
- cd hats
- cd ls
- cd grey
- ls
- cd solution
- ls
- cd patience
- ls
- cat SOLUTION.txt


# LEVEL02
- Like all the levels above, after having
 choose the "level02" using the command "cd 02". Then, I opened this folder using the command "ls -al" because it contained hidden folders. I opened the hidden folder ".porb", then "ls -al" to open the hidden file which contains the solution.
- cd ..
- cd level
- cd 02
- ls -al
- cd .porb
- ls -al
- cd .solution


# LEVEL03
- First, I used the "ls -al" command after entering the "03" folder because it contained a hidden file, and the solution was in this last file.
- cd ..
- cd level
- cd 03
- ls -al
- cat .bash_history

# LEVEL04
-First level04 was a hidden folder. That's why I used the command "ls -al" instead of "ls" to find it.


- cd ..
- cd level
- ls -al
- cd 04_kwisatz


# LEVEL05
-firstly level05 was not visible in the levels folders, that's why I used the "ls -al" command to find the hidden level "05_privacy". After that I just opened the folders and I found a file "README.md" which contained the solution.
- cd ..
- cd level
- ls -al
- cd 05_privacy
- ls
- cat README.md
-
